# Price-Prediction-Using-Adaboost

Project target was to build a program that can simulate placing long positions on a financial instrument market, based on a strategy generated by Adaboost algorithm. 
As the exemplary dataset I have downloaded Ethereum to USD pair from tradingview.com, which you can find in the resources dir.
The idea was to create a model that would tell if the market will rise by x%, not falling below y%.
For the given pair, model has 72% accuracy.

Whole simulation process is about changing:
1)	Training set starting date and size
2)	Reward/Risk ratio
3)	Number of steps and maximum iteration in Adaboost algorithm
4)	Position size
5)	Technical analysis indicators. I have used only RSI(14) and MACD(12, 26), as it was enough for ETH/USD

Metodology and solution
Program consists of 8 classes:
**Main** – class for setting variables values mentioned above
**PriceData** – wraps data from csv file
**DataImporter** – imports data from csv file to a list of PriceData type
**DataPreparation** – prepares imported data for simulation. 
First it labels data for binary classification. It marks row of data as 1 if it the price will hit the Take Profit level, before Stop Loss level. And marks it as -1 otherwise.
Then it changes position of indicators values in order for algorithm to not have data, that it wouldn’t have in real time environment.
Finally it splits data into training and testing sets.
